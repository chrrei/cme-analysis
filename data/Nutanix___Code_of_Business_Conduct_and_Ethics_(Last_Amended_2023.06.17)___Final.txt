iiiINTRODUCTION
This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (this “Code”) is designed to deter wrongdoing and to
promote:
• honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and professional rela_onships;
• full, fair, accurate, Nmely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents
we file with or submit to the U.S. Securi_es and Exchange Commission and in our
other public communica_ons;
• compliance with applicable laws, rules and regula_ons;
• the prompt internal reporNng of viola_ons of this Code; and
• accountability for adherence to this Code.
This Code applies to all directors, officers, and employees of Nutanix, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(collec_vely, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Nutanix,” or the “Company”), who, unless otherwise specified,
will be referred to jointly as “employees.” Agents and contractors of Nutanix are also expected
to read, understand and abide by this Code.
This Code should help guide your conduct in the course of our business. However, many of the
principles described in this Code are general in nature, and this Code does not cover every
situa_on that may arise. Use common sense and good judgment in applying this Code. If you
have any quesNons about applying this Code, it is your responsibility to seek guidance.
This Code is not the exclusive source of guidance and informa_on regarding the conduct of our
business. You should consult applicable policies and procedures in specific areas as they apply.
This Code is intended to supplement, not replace, the Company’s employment policies, work
rules and guidelines, as applicable, and the other policies and procedures of Nutanix.
We are commiied to con_nuously reviewing and upda_ng our policies and procedures. Nutanix
therefore reserves the right to amend, alter or terminate this Code at any _me and for any
reason, subject to applicable law.
It is your responsibility to ensure that you are consulNng the latest version of this Code to
guide your conduct in the course of our business.

2GENERAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
Overview
Honest and ethical conduct is cri_cal to our business. All employees, agents and contractors
have a duty to comply with applicable law and to act in an honest and ethical manner.
Compliance with law
You are responsible for complying with all laws, rules, regula_ons, and regulatory orders
applicable to the conduct of our business. If you are located or engaging in business outside of
the United States, you must comply with laws, rules, regula_ons, and regulatory orders of the
United States, including the Foreign Corrupt Prac_ces Act and U.S. export rules and regula_ons,
in addi_on to the applicable laws of other jurisdic_ons. If compliance with this Code should ever
conflict with law, you must comply with the law.
You should undertake to acquire knowledge of the legal requirements rela_ng to your du_es
sufficient to enable you to recognize poten_al dangers and to know when to seek advice from
managers or other appropriate personnel. In some instances, this may include knowing and
understanding legal requirements related to an_trust, privacy and data breach, government
contrac_ng, export controls, and/or immigra_on compliance.
Viola_ons of laws, rules, regula_ons, and orders may subject you to individual criminal or civil
liability, in addi_on to discipline by Nutanix. Viola_ons may also subject Nutanix to civil or
criminal liability or the loss of business.
No discriminaNon or harassment
Nutanix is commiied to providing a work environment that is free of discrimina_on and
harassment. Nutanix is an equal opportunity employer and makes employment decisions on the
basis of merit and business needs. In addi_on, Nutanix strictly prohibits harassment of any kind,
including harassment on the basis of race, color, veteran status, religion, gender, sex, sexual
orienta_on, age, mental or physical disability, medical condi_on, na_onal origin, marital status
or any other characteris_cs protected under applicable law or local ordinance.
3AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS
Overview
Your decisions and ac_ons in the course of your employment with Nutanix should be based on
the best interests of Nutanix, and not based on personal rela_onships or benefits. You should
seek to avoid situa_ons where your personal ac_vi_es and rela_onships conflict, or appear to
conflict, with the interests of Nutanix, except under guidelines approved by the Board of
Directors. This includes situa_ons where you may have or appear to have an indirect conflict
through, for example, a significant other or a rela_ve or other persons or en__es with which
you have a business, social, familial, personal, or other rela_onship. A conflict may also arise
when you take ac_ons or have interests that make it difficult for you to perform your work for
Nutanix objec_vely and effec_vely. You must disclose to your manager any interest that you
have that may, or may appear to, conflict with the interests of Nutanix.
There are a variety of situa_ons in which a conflict of interest may arise. While it would be
imprac_cal to aiempt to list all possible situa_ons, some common types of conflicts are
discussed below.
Outside employment and directorships
Unless you are a non-employee director of Nutanix, you may not perform services as a director,
employee, agent or contractor for a customer, a supplier, or any other en_ty without express
prior wriien approval from Nutanix’s Legal Department.
If you are an employee-director or an officer subject to the Sec_on 16 repor_ng requirements
of the Securi_es Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (a “Sec5on 16 Officer”), you must also
obtain prior approval from the Board of Directors. Requests for wriien approval to perform
such services should be submiied to conflicts@nutanix.com before you commence such
services.
Non-employee directors of Nutanix must promptly inform Nutanix of any such service.
Even if approved, all employees shall be limited to service on not more than one (1) board of
directors of a for-profit en_ty and service on not more than one (1) advisory board or
commiiee of a for-profit en_ty.
Excep_ons to these limits must be approved by the Board of Directors (for any employee-
directors or Sec_on 16 Officers) or the Chief Execu_ve Officer (for all other employees). You
may not perform services as a director, employee, agent or contractor for any compe_tor of
Nutanix. Furthermore, you remain subject to this Code in all respects, and it is your
responsibility to con_nue to comply with this Code, including its provision regarding conflicts of
interest and safeguarding of Company assets, while you serve as a director, employee, agent or
contractor for another en_ty.
4Financial interests in other companies
You should not have a financial interest—including an indirect interest through, for example, a
rela_ve or significant other—in any organiza_on if that interest would give you or would appear
to give you a conflict of interest with Nutanix. You should be par_cularly sensi_ve to financial
interests in compe_tors, suppliers, customers, distributors, and strategic partners.
TransacNons with Nutanix
If you have a significant financial interest in a transac_on involving Nutanix—including an
indirect interest through, for example, a rela_ve or significant other or a business en_ty—you
must disclose that interest, and that interest must be approved by Nutanix. We encourage you
to seek guidance if you have any ques_ons as to whether an interest in a transac_on is
significant. If it is determined that the transac_on is required to be reported under U.S.
Securi_es and Exchange Commission rules, the transac_on will be subject to review and
approval by the Audit Commiiee of the Board of Directors. Any dealings with a related party
must be conducted in such a way that no preferen_al treatment is given to that business.
Corporate opportuniNes
You may not directly or indirectly exploit for personal gain any opportuni_es that are discovered
through the use of corporate property, informa_on or posi_on unless the opportunity is
disclosed fully in wri_ng to the Board of Directors or its designated commiiee and the Board of
Directors or its designated commiiee declines to pursue the opportunity.
Loans by Nutanix
Loans from Nutanix to directors and execu_ve officers are prohibited. Loans from Nutanix to
other officers and employees must be approved in advance by the Board of Directors or its
designated commiiee.
Improper benefits
You may not receive any improper benefit as a result of your posi_on with Nutanix.
ElecNon or appointment to public office
You may serve in an elected or appointed public office provided that the posi_on does not
create or appear to create a conflict of interest. Requests for wriien approval to serve in such a
role should be submiied to conflicts@nutanix.com before you commence such service.
Guidance and approvals
5Evalua_ng whether a conflict of interest exists, or may appear to exist, requires the
considera_on of many factors. We encourage you to seek guidance and approval in any case
where you have any ques_ons or doubts. Nutanix may at any _me rescind prior approvals to
avoid a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, for any reason deemed to
be in the best interest of Nutanix.
6PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS
Public communicaNons and filings
Nutanix files reports and other documents with regulatory authori_es, including the U.S.
Securi_es and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq Stock Market. In addi_on, from _me-to-_me
Nutanix makes other public communica_ons, such as issuing press releases.
Depending upon your posi_on with Nutanix, you may be called upon to provide informa_on to
help assure that Nutanix’s public reports and communica_ons are complete, fair, accurate and
understandable. You are expected to use all reasonable efforts to provide complete, accurate,
objec_ve, relevant, _mely and understandable answers to inquiries related to Nutanix’s public
disclosures.
Individuals involved in the prepara_on of public reports and communica_ons must use all
reasonable efforts to comply with our disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed
to ensure full, fair, accurate, _mely and understandable disclosure in our public reports and
communica_ons.
If you believe that any disclosure is materially misleading or if you become aware of any
material informa_on that you believe should be disclosed to the public, it is your responsibility
to bring this informa_on to the aien_on of the Legal or Human Resources Department. If you
believe that ques_onable accoun_ng or audi_ng conduct or prac_ces have occurred or are
occurring, you should no_fy the Audit Commiiee of the Board of Directors.
CommunicaNon procedures
You may not communicate externally on behalf of Nutanix unless you are authorized to do so.
Nutanix has established specific policies regarding who may communicate informa_on to the
public, the press, market professionals (such as securi_es analysts, ins_tu_onal investors,
investment advisors, brokers, and dealers) and security holders on behalf of Nutanix. Only
employees who are specifically authorized by such policies may communicate externally on
behalf of the Company on the topics for which those employees are authorized to speak.
You should refer all calls or other inquiries from the press, market professionals or security
holders to the Investor Rela_ons or Corporate Communica_ons Departments for handling.
All communica_ons made to public audiences on behalf of Nutanix, including formal
communica_ons and presenta_ons made to investors, customers, or the press, require prior
approval in accordance with the Company’s established policies for such communica_ons,
which approval will include a review by Investor Rela_ons or Corporate Communica_ons
personnel, as applicable, as well as Accoun_ng and Legal personnel.
7FINANCIAL REPORTING
Overview
As a public company, we are required to follow strict accoun_ng principles and standards, to
report financial informa_on accurately and completely in accordance with these principles and
standards, and to have appropriate internal controls and procedures to ensure that our
accoun_ng and financial repor_ng complies with law. The integrity of our financial transac_ons
and records is cri_cal to the opera_on of our business and is a key factor in maintaining the
confidence and trust of our employees, security holders and other stakeholders.
Compliance with rules, controls, and procedures
It is important that all transac_ons are properly recorded, classified, and summarized in our
financial statements, books, and records in accordance with our policies, controls and
procedures, as well as all generally accepted accoun_ng principles, standards, laws, rules and
regula_ons for accoun_ng and financial repor_ng.
If you have responsibility for or any involvement in financial repor_ng or accoun_ng, you should
have an appropriate understanding of, and you should seek in good faith to adhere to, relevant
accoun_ng and financial repor_ng principles, standards, laws, rules, and regula_ons and
Nutanix’s financial and accoun_ng policies, controls, and procedures. This includes ensuring that
all bookkeeping and records comply with the Foreign Corrupt Prac_ces Act where applicable, as
explained in greater detail in Nutanix’s An_-Corrup_on Compliance Policy and Guidelines. If you
are a director level employee or higher, you should seek to ensure that the internal controls and
procedures in your business area are in place, understood and followed.
Accuracy of records and reports
It is important that those who rely on records and reports—managers and other decision
makers, creditors, customers, and auditors—have complete, accurate and _mely informa_on.
False, misleading, or incomplete informa_on undermines Nutanix’s ability to make good
decisions about resources, employees and programs and may, in some cases, result in viola_ons
of law. Anyone involved in preparing financial or accoun_ng records or reports, including
financial statements and schedules, must be diligent in assuring that those records and reports
are complete, accurate and _mely. Anyone represen_ng or cer_fying as to the accuracy of such
records and reports should make an inquiry or review adequate to establish a good faith belief
in their accuracy.
Even if you are not directly involved in financial repor_ng or accoun_ng, you are likely involved
with financial records or reports of some kind—a voucher, _me sheet, invoice, or expense
report. In addi_on, most employees have involvement with product, marke_ng or
administra_ve ac_vi_es, or performance evalua_ons, which can affect our reported financial
condi_on or results. Therefore, Nutanix expects you, regardless of whether you are otherwise
8required to be familiar with finance or accoun_ng maiers, to use all reasonable efforts to
ensure that every business record or report with which you deal is accurate, complete, and
reliable, and recorded in accordance with Company policies.
IntenNonal misconduct
You may not inten_onally misrepresent Nutanix’s financial performance or otherwise
inten_onally compromise the integrity of Nutanix’s reports, records, policies, and procedures.
For example, you may not:
• report informa_on or enter informa_on in Nutanix’s books, records or reports that
fraudulently or inten_onally hides, misrepresents, or disguises the true nature of
any financial or non-financial transac_on or result;
• establish any undisclosed or unrecorded fund, account, asset, or liability for any
improper purpose;
• enter into any transac_on or agreement that accelerates, postpones, or otherwise
manipulates the accurate and _mely recording of revenues or expenses;
• inten_onally misclassify transac_ons as to accounts, business units or accoun_ng
periods; or
• knowingly assist others in any of the above.
Dealing with auditors
Our auditors have a duty to review our records in a fair and accurate manner. You are expected
to cooperate with independent and internal auditors in good faith and in accordance with law.
In addi_on, you must not fraudulently induce or influence, coerce, manipulate, or mislead our
independent or internal auditors regarding financial records, processes, controls or procedures
or other maiers relevant to their engagement.
You may not engage, directly or indirectly, any outside auditors to perform any audit, audit-
related, tax or other services, including consul_ng, without wriien approval from the Vice
President of Accoun_ng and the Audit Commiiee of the Board of Directors.
ObligaNon to invesNgate and report potenNal violaNons
You should make appropriate inquiries in the event you may see, for example:
• financial results that seem inconsistent with underlying business performance;
• inaccurate financial records, including travel and expense reports, _me sheets or
invoices;
• the circumven_ng of mandated review and approval procedures;
• transac_ons that appear inconsistent with good business economics;
• the absence or weakness of processes or controls; or
• persons within Nutanix seeking to improperly influence the work of our financial or
accoun_ng personnel, or our external or internal auditors.
9Dishonest or inaccurate repor_ng can lead to civil or even criminal liability for you and Nutanix
and can lead to a loss of public faith in Nutanix. You are required to promptly report any case of
suspected financial or opera_onal misrepresenta_on or impropriety.
Keeping the Audit CommiXee informed
The Audit Commiiee plays an important role in ensuring the integrity of our public reports. If
you believe that ques_onable accoun_ng or audi_ng conduct or prac_ces have occurred or are
occurring, you should no_fy the Audit Commiiee of the Board of Directors. In par_cular, the
Chief Execu_ve Officer and senior financial officers such as the Chief Financial Officer and Vice
President of Accoun_ng should promptly bring to the aien_on of the Audit Commiiee any
informa_on of which he or she may become aware concerning, for example:
• the accuracy of material disclosures made by Nutanix in its public filings;
• material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial
repor_ng;
• any evidence of fraud that involves an employee who has a significant role in
Nutanix’s financial repor_ng, disclosures or internal controls or procedures; or
• any evidence of a material viola_on of the policies in this Code regarding financial
repor_ng.
10SAFEGUARDING COMPANY ASSETS
Overview
All employees, agents and contractors are responsible for the proper use of company assets.
This responsibility applies to all of Nutanix’s assets, including your _me, work and work product;
cash and accounts; physical assets such as inventory, equipment, vehicles, computers, systems,
facili_es and supplies; intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, inven_ons,
technology and trade secrets; and other proprietary or nonpublic informa_on.
• You should use all reasonable efforts to safeguard company assets against loss,
damage, misuse, or theq.
• You should ensure the accuracy of all expense reports submiied to the Company
and ensure such submissions are made in compliance with applicable Company
policies and procedures.
• You should be alert to situa_ons that could lead to loss, damage, misuse, or theq of
company assets, and should report any loss, damage, misuse, or theq as soon as it
comes to your aien_on.
• You should not use, transfer, misappropriate, loan, sell or donate company assets
without appropriate authoriza_on.
• You must take reasonable steps to ensure that Nutanix receives good value for
company funds spent.
• You may not use company assets in a manner that would result in or facilitate the
viola_on of law.
• You should use and safeguard assets entrusted to Nutanix’s custody by customers,
suppliers, and others in the same manner as company assets.
ProtecNng Nutanix’s informaNon
In the course of your involvement with Nutanix, you may come into possession of informa_on
that has not been disclosed or made available to the general public. This nonpublic informa_on
may include, among other things:
• financial data and projec_ons including but not limited to sales bookings and
pipelines;
• proprietary and technical informa_on, such as trade secrets, patents, inven_ons,
product plans and customer lists;
• informa_on regarding corporate developments, such as business strategies, plans
for acquisi_ons or other business combina_ons, dives_tures, major contracts,
expansion plans, financing transac_ons and management changes;
• personal informa_on about employees; and
• nonpublic informa_on of customers, suppliers, and others.
11If you have any ques_ons as to what cons_tutes nonpublic informa_on, please consult the Legal
Department.
All nonpublic informa_on must only be used for company business purposes. You have an
obliga_on to use all reasonable efforts to safeguard Nutanix’s nonpublic informa_on. You may
not disclose nonpublic informa_on to anyone outside of Nutanix, except when disclosure is
required by law or when disclosure is required for business purposes and appropriate steps
have been taken to prevent misuse of that informa_on. This responsibility includes not
disclosing nonpublic informa_on in Internet discussion groups, chat rooms, bulle_n boards or
other electronic media. In cases where disclosing nonpublic informa_on is required or
necessary, you should coordinate with the Legal Department. The misuse of nonpublic
informa_on is contrary to company policy and may also be a viola_on of law.
Each employee is required to sign an Employment, Confiden_al Informa_on and Inven_on
Assignment Agreement, or equivalent agreements that address the use and disclosure of
confiden_al informa_on of Nutanix.
ProhibiNon on insider trading
You may not directly or indirectly—through, for example, significant others, family members or
controlled en__es—buy or sell stocks or other securi_es of Nutanix or any other company
based on nonpublic informa_on obtained from your work at Nutanix. In addi_on, you may not
“_p” others by providing them nonpublic informa_on under circumstances that suggest that
you were trying to help them make an investment decision. These obliga_ons are in addi_on to
your obliga_ons with respect to nonpublic informa_on generally, as discussed above.
Under U.S. securi_es laws, it is unlawful for any person who has “material” nonpublic
informa_on about a company to trade in the stock or other securi_es of that company or to
disclose such informa_on to others who may trade.
Material nonpublic informa_on is informa_on about a company that is not known to the
general public and that a typical investor would consider important in making a decision to buy,
sell or hold securi_es. Viola_ons of U.S. securi_es laws may result in civil and criminal penal_es,
including disgorgement of profits, civil judgments, fines, and jail sentences.
You should be aware that stock market surveillance techniques are becoming increasingly
sophis_cated, and the probability that U.S. federal or other regulatory authori_es will detect
and prosecute even small-level trading is significant. Insider trading rules are strictly enforced,
even in instances when the financial transac_ons seem small.
You may not make an unauthorized disclosure of any nonpublic informa_on acquired in the
course of your service with Nutanix or misuse material nonpublic informa_on in securi_es
trading. Any such ac_ons will be deemed viola_ons of Nutanix’s Insider Trading Policy. All
employees should be familiar with Nutanix’s policy regarding Insider Trading. If you have any
12ques_ons at all regarding trading in Nutanix’s securi_es, contact the Legal Department for
guidance.
Maintaining and managing records
Nutanix is required by local, state, federal, foreign and other applicable laws, rules and
regula_ons to retain certain records and to follow specific guidelines in managing its records.
Records include paper documents, email, electronic files and records (including those stored in
cloud-based services and repositories), computer hard drives (including USB drives), and all
other recorded informa_on, regardless of medium or characteris_cs. Civil and criminal penal_es
for failure to comply with such guidelines can be severe for employees, agents, contractors and
Nutanix.
You should consult with the Legal Department regarding the reten_on of records in the case of
actual or threatened li_ga_on or government inves_ga_on. The Legal Department will no_fy
you if a “Legal Hold” is placed on records for which you are responsible. A Legal Hold suspends
all document destruc_on procedures in order to preserve appropriate records under special
circumstances, such as li_ga_on or government inves_ga_ons. The Legal Department
determines and iden_fies what types of records or documents are required to be placed under
a Legal Hold. If a Legal Hold is placed on records for which you are responsible, you must
preserve and protect the necessary records in accordance with instruc_ons from the Legal
Department.
Records or supporNng documents that are subject to a Legal Hold must not be destroyed,
altered, or modified under any circumstance. A Legal Hold remains effec_ve un_l it is officially
released in wri_ng by the Legal Department. If you are unsure whether a document has been
placed under a Legal Hold, you should preserve and protect that document while you check
with the Legal Department.
13RESPONSIBILITIES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND COMPETITORS
Overview
You should respect the rights of, and deal fairly with, Nutanix’s customers, suppliers, business
partners and compe_tors in compliance with law. You should not take unfair advantage of
anyone through decep_on, misrepresenta_on, manipula_on, coercion, abuse of privileged
informa_on or any inten_onal unfair business prac_ce.
Improper payments
You should not authorize, offer, promise, or give, or solicit or accept, money, giqs,
entertainment, privileges, gratui_es, benefits, or other items of value intended to improperly
influence, directly or indirectly, any business decision or that otherwise violate law or create the
appearance of impropriety. The offering or acceptance of improper payments when dealing
with foreign officials or commercial en__es abroad can also result in viola_ons of the Foreign
Corrupt Prac_ces Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and other foreign laws and regula_ons
prohibi_ng corrup_on and commercial bribery. Nutanix’s An_-Corrup_on Compliance Policy and
Guidelines sets forth in greater detail Nutanix’s policies and prac_ces regarding these payments.
You should contact the Legal Department if you have any ques_ons as to whether a payment is
proper.
Gi‘s and entertainment
You may, from _me to _me, provide or accept business ameni_es to aid in building legi_mate
business rela_onships. Business ameni_es may include giqs, meals, services, entertainment,
reimbursements, loans, favors, privileges, or other items of value.
Any business amenity should be consistent with customary business prac_ce and should be
reasonable and appropriate for the circumstance. Business ameni_es should not be lavish or
excessive. Business ameni_es should not violate law or create an appearance of impropriety.
You should avoid providing or accep_ng any cash payment, or other business amenity that can
be construed as a bribe or payoff. All company funds expended for business ameni_es must be
accurately recorded in Nutanix’s books and records. For addi_onal details on policies and
prac_ces rela_ng to giqs and entertainments and the propriety of such giqs when dealing with
foreign officials or foreign commercial en__es, please see Nutanix’s An_-Corrup_on Compliance
Policy and Guidelines. We encourage you to contact the Legal Department if you have any
ques_ons as to whether a business amenity is permissible.
In some business situa_ons outside of the United States, it is customary and lawful for business
execu_ves to present giqs to representa_ves of their business partners. These giqs may be of
more than a nominal value, and under the circumstances, returning the giqs or paying for them
14may be an affront to the giver. If you find yourself in such a situa_on, you must report the giq to
the Chief Legal Officer. In some cases, you may be required to turn the giq over to Nutanix.
Special restric_ons apply when dealing with government employees. For more informa_on, see
the next sec_on on “Working with Governments.”
SelecNng suppliers
Nutanix’s policy is to select suppliers based on the merits of their products, services and
business prac_ces and to purchase supplies based on need, quality, service, price and other
terms and condi_ons of sale. You may not establish a business rela_onship with any supplier if
you know or have reason to know that its business prac_ces violate applicable laws.
Procurement and So‘ware Use
Nutanix ensures that it appropriately procures any goods and services, including soqware, cloud
services, and/or data that it uses. Whenever purchasing any goods or services you must follow
all applicable procurement policies and procedures. For addi_onal informa_on, see the Nutanix
Purchase Order Policy and the Contract Review, Approval and Signature Authority Policy.
Any employee procuring soqware, cloud services, or data from a third-party vendor must do so
through the appropriate procurement process and must ensure that such soqware, cloud
services, or data is used in accordance with its license, and that sufficient licenses are procured
to meet the expected need. Any overuse of soqware cloud services, or data must be
appropriately addressed with the vendor according to the terms of the applicable agreement.
Employees may assume that any soqware, cloud services, or data provided by IT or obtained
through approved Nutanix channels is appropriately licensed.
Nutanix may periodically audit procurement and soqware usage. Your obliga_ons with respect
to these audits is discussed in “Dealing with auditors” above. If you have any ques_ons about
whether your soqware is appropriately licensed, please contact Legal or
codeofconduct@nutanix.com.
Handling the nonpublic informaNon of others
You must handle the nonpublic informa_on of others responsibly and in accordance with our
agreements with them. Nonpublic informa_on of others includes notes, reports, conclusions,
and other materials prepared by a company employee based on the nonpublic informa_on of
others.
You should not knowingly accept informa_on offered by a third party, including a customer,
supplier, or business partner, that is represented as nonpublic, or that appears from the context
or circumstances to be nonpublic, unless an appropriate nondisclosure agreement (“NDA”) has
15been signed with the party offering the informa_on. You should contact the Legal Department
to coordinate the appropriate execu_on of NDAs on behalf of Nutanix.
Even aqer a nondisclosure agreement is in place, you should accept only the informa_on that is
necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purpose of receiving it, such as a decision on
whether to proceed to nego_ate an agreement. If more detailed or extensive informa_on is
offered and it is not necessary or appropriate for your immediate purposes, it should be
refused. If any such informa_on is inadvertently received, it should be transferred to the Legal
Department for appropriate disposi_on.
Once Nutanix has received nonpublic informa_on, you should use all reasonable efforts to:
• abide by the terms of the relevant nondisclosure agreement, including any
obliga_ons with respect to the return or destruc_on of the nonpublic informa_on;
• limit the use of the nonpublic informa_on to the purpose for which it was
disclosed; and
• disseminate the nonpublic informa_on only to those other company employees,
agents, or contractors with a need to know the informa_on to perform their jobs
for Nutanix, as may be set forth in the relevant NDA.
Improperly obtaining or using assets or informaNon
You may not unlawfully obtain or use the materials, products, intellectual property, proprietary
or nonpublic informa_on or other assets of anyone, including suppliers, customers, business
partners and compe_tors. You must respect the copyrights of others and may not use soqware,
services, or other copyrighted material, if doing so would violate the rights of a copyright holder
or exceed the terms of a license. You may not coerce or improperly induce past or present
employees of other companies to disclose proprietary or nonpublic informa_on of their former
or other employers.
Free and fair compeNNon
It is our policy to lawfully compete in the marketplace. Our commitment to fairness includes
respec_ng the rights of our compe_tors to compete lawfully in the marketplace and abiding by
all applicable laws in the course of compe_ng.
Most countries have well-developed bodies of law designed to encourage and protect free and
fair compe__on. These laws are broad and far-reaching and regulate Nutanix’s rela_onships
with its distributors, resellers, suppliers, and customers. Compe__on laws generally address the
following areas: pricing prac_ces (including predatory pricing, price fixing and price
discrimina_on), discoun_ng, terms of sale, credit terms, promo_onal allowances, secret
rebates, exclusive dealerships or distributorships, product bundling, restric_ons on carrying
compe_ng products, termina_on, and many other prac_ces.
16Compe__on laws also govern, usually quite strictly, rela_onships between Nutanix and its
compe_tors. Collusion among compe_tors is illegal, and the consequences of a viola_on are
severe. You must not enter into an agreement or understanding, wriien or oral, express, or
implied, with any compe_tor concerning prices, discounts or other terms or condi_ons of sale;
profits or profit margins; costs; alloca_on of product, customers, markets, or territories;
limita_ons on produc_on or supply; boycois of customers or suppliers; or bids or the intent to
bid, or even discuss or exchange informa_on on these subjects.
Nutanix is commiied to obeying both the leier and spirit of these laws, which are oqen
referred to as an_trust, consumer protec_on, compe__on, or unfair compe__on laws. Although
the spirit of these laws is straighrorward, their applica_on to par_cular situa_ons can be quite
complex. To ensure that Nutanix complies fully with these laws, you should have a basic
knowledge of them and should promptly involve our Legal Department when ques_onable
situa_ons arise.
17WORKING WITH GOVERNMENTS
Overview
Special rules govern our business and other dealings with governments. Employees, agents, and
contractors of Nutanix should use all reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and
regula_ons governing contact and dealings with governments, government employees and
public officials. If you deal with governments, government employees or public officials, you
should undertake to understand the special rules that apply. If you have any ques_ons
concerning government rela_ons, you should contact the Legal Department.
Government contracts
You should use all reasonable efforts to comply with all relevant laws and regula_ons that apply
to government contrac_ng. You should refer any contract with any governmental en_ty to the
Legal Department for review and approval.
Requests by regulatory authoriNes
You must cooperate with appropriate government inquiries and inves_ga_ons in accordance
with law. It is important, however, to protect the legal rights of Nutanix with respect to its
nonpublic informa_on. All government requests for company informa_on, documents or
inves_ga_ve interviews should be referred to the Legal Department. You should work with the
Legal Department in responding to requests by regulatory authori_es to ensure appropriate
responses and to avoid inappropriate disclosure of aiorney-client privileged materials, trade
secret informa_on or other nonpublic informa_on. This policy should not be construed to
prevent an employee from disclosing informa_on to a government or law enforcement agency
where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the informa_on discloses a viola_on
of, or noncompliance with, a state or federal statute or regula_on.
Improper payments to government officials
You may not offer any payment or business amenity to a public official or a government
employee if doing so could reasonably be construed as having any connec_on with Nutanix’s
business, even if it has a nominal value or no value at all. You should be aware that what may be
permissible in dealings with commercial businesses may be deemed illegal and possibly criminal
in dealings with the government. You should contact the Legal Department for guidance.
Whether you are located in the United States or abroad, you are also responsible for fully
complying with the Foreign Corrupt Prac_ces Act. The Foreign Corrupt Prac_ces Act makes it
illegal to offer, pay, promise to pay, or authorize to pay any money, giq or other item of value to
any foreign official, poli_cal party or candidate to assist Nutanix or another to obtain or retain
business. The Foreign Corrupt Prac_ces Act forbids doing indirectly, such as through an agent,
reseller, or consultant, what it would be illegal to do directly. All managers and supervisory
18personnel are expected to monitor con_nued compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Prac_ces
Act. If you have ques_ons or concerns about the Foreign Corrupt Prac_ces Act, please refer to
Nutanix’s An_-Corrup_on Compliance Policy and Guidelines or contact the Legal Department.
PoliNcal contribuNons
Nutanix reserves the right to communicate its posi_on on important issues to elected
representa_ves and other government officials. It is Nutanix’s policy to comply fully with all
local, state, federal, foreign, and other applicable laws, rules, and regula_ons regarding poli_cal
contribu_ons. Nutanix’s assets—including company funds, employees’ work _me and company
premises and equipment—must not be used for, or be contributed to, poli_cal campaigns or
poli_cal ac_vi_es under any circumstances without prior wriien approval.
Lobbying
You must obtain approval from the Chief Legal Officer for any work ac_vity that requires
lobbying communica_on with any member or employee of a legisla_ve body or with any
government official or employee in the formula_on of legisla_on. Work ac_vity covered by this
policy includes mee_ngs with legislators or members of their staffs or with senior execu_ve
branch officials on behalf of Nutanix. Prepara_on, research, and other background ac_vi_es
that are done in support of such lobbying communica_on are also covered by this policy even if
the communica_on ul_mately is not made.
Trade restricNons
A number of countries maintain controls on the des_na_ons to which products or soqware may
be exported. Some of the strictest export controls are maintained by the United States against
countries that the U.S. government considers unfriendly or as suppor_ng interna_onal
terrorism. The U.S. regula_ons are complex and apply both to deemed exports from the United
States and to deemed exports of products from other countries when those products contain
U.S.-origin components or technology. For example, soqware created in the United States is
subject to these regula_ons even if duplicated and packaged abroad. In some circumstances, an
oral presenta_on containing technical data made to foreign na_onals in the United States or
access by foreign na_onals to certain technology may cons_tute a controlled export. The Legal
Department can provide you with guidance on which countries are prohibited des_na_ons for
company products or whether a proposed technical presenta_on or the provision of controlled
technology to foreign na_onals may require a U.S. government license.
ImmigraNon laws
The United States and other countries impose restric_ons on non-ci_zens visi_ng or working in
the country. In many instances visas or work permits must be obtained from the government.
You are responsible for complying with all applicable immigra_on laws. If you have any
uncertainty concerning the requirements of the law, you should consult with the Legal
19Department before working in, or travelling to, a country of which that person is not a ci_zen or
authorizing any person to do so.
20PROCEDURAL MATTERS

Code and that they understand and agree to comply with its provisions; an electronic signature
will be sufficient in this regard. Signed acknowledgment forms will be kept in your personnel
file. Failure to read this Code or to sign an acknowledgement form does not excuse any person
from the terms of this Code.
Approvals and waivers
Except as otherwise provided in this Code, the Board of Directors or its designated commiiee
must review and approve any maiers requiring special permission under this Code for a
member of the Board of Directors or an execu_ve officer. Except as otherwise provided in this

contractor.
Any waiver of any provision of this Code for a member of the Board of Directors or an execu_ve
officer must be approved in wri_ng by the Board of Directors or its designated commiiee and
promptly disclosed, along with the reasons for the waiver, to the extent required by law or
regula_on. Any waiver of any provision of this Code with respect to any other employee, agent
or contractor must be approved in wri_ng by the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Legal
Officer.
Copies of approvals and waivers will be retained by Nutanix.
Seeking Guidance
You are encouraged to and may always seek guidance from and direct ques_ons to managers or
other appropriate personnel in the Human Resources or Legal Departments when in doubt
about the best course of ac_on to take in a par_cular situa_on. In addi_on, ques_ons regarding
this Code may be directed to Nutanix’s Head of Human Resources or Chief Legal Officer, or via
email to codeofconduct@nutanix.com, while concerns or suspected viola_ons should be
handled according to the procedures in the Repor_ng Viola_ons sec_on below.
ReporNng violaNons
21You should promptly report viola_ons or suspected viola_ons of this Code through an
appropriate channel. Nutanix provides many alterna_ve channels to foster an environment
where employees feel comfortable raising any such viola_ons:
• You should feel free to raise such maiers with any member of senior management,
your Human Resources business partners, the Head of Human Resources, a
member of the Legal Department, the Chief Legal Officer, the Chief Financial Officer,
or by sending an email to codeofconduct@nutanix.com (which is monitored by
certain members of Nutanix internal compliance teams).
• If your concerns relate to accoun_ng, internal controls or audi_ng maiers, or if the
Chief Legal Officer or other designated Legal Department contact is implicated in
any viola_on or suspected viola_on, you may also contact the Audit Commiiee of
the Board of Directors at 1740 Technology Drive, Suite 150, San Jose, California
95110, ATTENTION: Audit Commiiee of Nutanix, Inc.
• You may also report a viola_on or suspected viola_on to Nutanix’s confiden_al
hotline by (a) calling +1 (844) 723-8366 (from the U.S.) or (b) through a secure web
form at nutanix.ethicspoint.com.
In all circumstances, you are encouraged to share your iden_ty when repor_ng, as it will help
Nutanix conduct the most thorough inves_ga_on possible, because it is more difficult to
thoroughly inves_gate anonymous reports. However, if you are uncomfortable doing so, you
may also report anonymously. If you make an anonymous report, please provide as much detail
as possible, including copies of any documents that you believe may be relevant to the issue.
When reports are not made anonymously, reasonable efforts will be made to keep your iden_ty
confiden_al. In certain circumstances, however, your iden_ty may become apparent during an
inves_ga_on or may need to be disclosed (e.g., in regulatory proceedings). Accordingly, it is not
possible for Nutanix to give a blanket guarantee of confiden_ality.
Reprisals, threats, retribu_on, or retalia_on against any person who has, in good faith, reported
a viola_on or a suspected viola_on of laws, rules, regula_ons, this Code, or other company
policies, or against any person who is, in good faith, assis_ng in any inves_ga_on or process with
respect to such a viola_on, is strictly prohibited. Concerns about retalia_on or threatened
retalia_on should be reported through one of the channels listed above.
InvesNgaNons
The Board of Directors or its designated commiiee will be responsible for inves_ga_ng
viola_ons and determining appropriate disciplinary ac_on for maiers involving members of the
Board of Directors or execu_ve officers. The Board of Directors or its designated commiiee may
designate others to conduct or manage inves_ga_ons on its behalf and recommend disciplinary
ac_on.
22Subject to the general authority of the Board of Directors to administer this Code, the Chief
Financial Officer and the Chief Legal Officer will be jointly responsible for inves_ga_ng viola_ons
and determining appropriate disciplinary ac_on for other employees, agents, and contractors.
The Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Legal Officer may designate others to conduct or
manage inves_ga_ons on their behalf and recommend disciplinary ac_on. The Chief Financial
Officer and the Chief Legal Officer will periodically report Code viola_ons and the correc_ve
ac_ons taken to the Board of Directors or its designated commiiee. The Board of Directors
reserves the right to inves_gate viola_ons and determine appropriate disciplinary ac_on on its
own and to designate others to do so in place of, or in addi_on to, the Chief Financial Officer
and the Chief Legal Officer.
Nutanix will promptly inves_gate any suspected viola_ons. A person suspected of viola_ng this
Code may be suspended with or without pay while an inves_ga_on is conducted. Nutanix will
follow local grievance procedures in jurisdic_ons where such procedures apply.
Disciplinary acNon
Nutanix will take appropriate ac_on against any employee, agent, or contractor whose ac_ons
are found to violate this Code. Disciplinary ac_ons may include, at Nutanix’s sole discre_on, oral
or wriien reprimand, suspension or immediate termina_on of employment or business
rela_onship, or any other disciplinary ac_on or combina_on of disciplinary ac_ons as deemed
appropriate to the circumstances. A record of the disciplinary ac_on will be retained in the
employee’s personnel file.
In determining what disciplinary ac_on is appropriate in a par_cular case, Nutanix will take into
account all relevant informa_on, including the nature and severity of the viola_on, any history
of warnings and viola_ons, whether the viola_on appears to have been inten_onal or
inadvertent and whether the violator reported his or her own misconduct. Nutanix will strive to
enforce this Code in a consistent manner while accoun_ng for all relevant informa_on.
Where Nutanix has suffered a loss, it may pursue its remedies against the individuals or en__es
responsible. Certain viola_ons of this Code may also be subject to civil or criminal prosecu_on
by governmental authori_es and others. Where laws have been violated, Nutanix’s remedial
ac_ons may include repor_ng violators to the appropriate authori_es.
23ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

or term of employment. Employment at Nutanix is employment at-will. Employment at-will may
