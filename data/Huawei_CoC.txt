5. Guidelines for Ethical Behaviour 
Business Activities and Relationships

Huawei Staff shall conduct their business in a lawful and ethical manner at all times while conducting business activities and dealing with business relationships.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption

Huawei recognizes that corruption can have a detrimental effect on society by undermining legal systems; damaging social and economic development; and free and fair competition. Huawei is committed to carrying out our business in an honest and ethical manner which is reflected within our business principles that form the foundation of our Company.

Huawei has a zero tolerance of bribery and corruption. Huawei will comply in all respects with all applicable domestic and international laws, standards and principles relating to anti-bribery in each of the countries in which Huawei trades, operates or has any other activity.

We are committed to the following:

    To carry out our business fairly, honestly and transparently;
    To not make or receive bribes, or condone the offering of bribes on our behalf, so as to gain or retain a business advantage;
    Avoid doing business with others who do not accept our principles and who may harm our reputation;
    Keep transparent and updated records;
    Make sure that everyone in our business knows and adheres to our principles; and
    Keep our principles even when it becomes difficult.

Staffs are referred to Huawei’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy（which is published on W3 and updated from time to time) for further guidance. The policies can also be provided by HR upon request. Any Staff member who is found to be giving or taking bribes or any other acts of corruption, will be subject to disciplinary action which may lead to dismissal on the grounds of gross misconduct (if not a Huawei employee, the procedure shall involve a review and the likely termination of the responsible individual’s appointment to Huawei and/or contract) and, may even be subject to criminal proceedings.
Gifts and hospitality

Huawei Staff must not solicit gifts or hospitality in any circumstances.  As a general principle, we discourage Staff from accepting gifts or hospitality from a business partner.

Notwithstanding this, Huawei recognizes that the occasional acceptance or offer of modest gifts and hospitality may be a legitimate contribution to good business relationships. However, it is important that gifts or hospitality shall be suitable for the conduct of normal business relationships and shall never influence business decision-making processes, or cause others to perceive as an influence. The prohibitions against accepting or paying bribes and the avoidance of conflicts of interest should always be taken into consideration.

You shall make sure you get the right approvals before you either offer or accept gifts or hospitality and register any gifts or hospitality that are offered to or accepted by you.

You may never accept or offer the following with or without approval:

    Illegal gifts or hospitality;
    Gifts or hospitality that is of an inappropriate nature or in inappropriate venues or that might adversely affect Huawei’s reputation;
    Gifts or hospitality that the giver knows are prohibited by the recipient’s organization;
    Cash or cash equivalents such as gift vouchers, stocks, loans or options;
    Travel arrangement for the purpose of tourism, flight upgrading;
    Job arrangement for a relative of a customer (except where the job offer is made via a fair, public and formal recruitment and selection procedure);
    Personal services;
    Gifts or hospitality during a tender exercise or during periods when important business decisions are being made.

Staffs are referred to Huawei’s Gifts and Hospitality Policy（which is published on W3 and may be updated from time to time and may be provided by HR upon request）for detailed guidance on the acceptance and offering of gifts and hospitality. It is the responsibility of each Huawei Staff member to familiarize themselves with Huawei’s Gifts and Hospitality Policy and processes and to act in accordance and compliance with it. Huawei requires its Staff to abide by these rules not only to protect our reputation and efforts to reduce and eliminate bribery and corruption in business worldwide, but also to protect the individual Staff member against unfounded allegations of improper behavior.
Promotion and Commitment

The Staff who are involved with Advertising and Marketing should make sure that promotional literature is accurate and truthful in regards to the promotion of the Company’s product and services.
The Selection of Suppliers

Huawei requires its Staff to maintain professional and lawful relationships with all its suppliers, including business partners such as agents, distributors, joint ventures or allies. Meanwhile, Huawei will require its business partners to accept and honor the Huawei Code of Business Conduct.

Selection of suppliers will be based on objective business criterion and where member of Staff does not have the expert knowledge of the professional area of the supplier, they must seek an advice from a member of Staff who does.
Ensuring Fair Transactions

Staff must not entrust business to a supplier owned or managed by his/her relative or close friend. If a member of Staff’s relative has interests in one of Huawei suppliers, the Company will not enter into any form of business partnership with the supplier.

Business information of suppliers and other business partners must be kept confidential. Product conditions and quotations as well as Huawei assessment of suppliers are all trade secrets. No trade secret shall be disclosed to any other supplier.
6. Respecting Differences 

Cultural differences and religious beliefs among customers, suppliers, business partners and their staff from all over the world must be respected at all times.
Complying with Local Country Laws and International Rules and Regulations

Huawei business reaches many countries worldwide and its Staff consist of many different nationalities and ethnicities with many different beliefs. As a global operator we must ensure that our business operations are in compliance with the laws of local countries, regions, or regional economic communities, international practice and recognized standards. These laws or standards deal with a wide range of aspects, including investment, trade, foreign exchange, labor, environment, contract, consumer protection, bribery and corruption, intellectual property right, accounting and taxation.

    The Staff will ensure that they understand and observe the laws and regulations relating to trade secret, proprietary information and other intellectual property rights, and respect others’ effective intellectual property rights. Avoid improper economic or criminal practices relating to the use of others’ intellectual property rights.
    Understand and comply with the regulations and conventions in relation to human rights recognised by the International Community.
    Ensure that fair employment opportunities are being offered and that recruitment, employment, and promotion of employees are based solely on individual talents, qualifications and achievements.

Technology and trade secrets are amongst Huawei’s most important assets and it is the duty of all the Company’s Staff to protect all the physical assets, financial assets, information assets and other invisible assets in the possession of Huawei. If you suspect that information is being disclosed by a third party, you have a duty to report the breach to the manager of the department in which you work, or Huawei’s Compliance Officer.

The Staff member shall provide the Intellectual Property Right Department with copies of any patent that he/she has applied for or obtained. The Staff member shall return the media and copies in his/her hands which contain Huawei proprietary information when he/she leaves the company. After the Staff member leaves the Company, these intellectual property rights shall remain the property of Huawei and the Staff member will continue to be bound by their ongoing obligations of confidentiality regarding the proprietary information.
    Before applying for patents with the assistance of the Intellectual Property Right Department, a Staff member must not present or disclose any information relating to a new product or service without authorization. In the development or use of a new product or service name, make sure if any IPR-related issue persists.
    Every Staff member must use all due skill and diligence to avoid the inadvertent disclosure of proprietary information such as intellectual property rights. You should never discuss with any unauthorized person including family members, friends, customers or suppliers about any proprietary information Huawei has not made public.

The Staff must not disclose any inside information unless expressly instructed to do so by the manager of the department in which they work in order to fulfill a business need.

    Where a Staff member’s financial submissions appear to be inconsistent, the issue will be raised with the manager of the department in which the respective Staff member works.
