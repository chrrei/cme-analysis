Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics
Leading with CareMessage from Eric Yuan
Dear Zoomies,
As we tirelessly work and innovate to empower people to accomplish
more by making video communications frictionless and secure, we must
remember to conduct our business with uncompromising integrity and care
for our community, customers, company, teammates, and selves. Especially
in these challenging and transformative times, our dedication to delivering
happiness to our community, customers, and shareholders must include a
commitment to doing business the right way, in compliance with the law and
ethical business standards. Please read our Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics and understand how it applies to your work at Zoom. It is of utmost
importance, because I expect every Zoomie to lead with integrity and care,
in compliance with the law and our Code.
With gratitude,
Eric Yuan
Founder & Chief Executive Officer
